## About me

I'm a professional Senior Backend Developer with proficiency in various technologies, including Golang, databases, brokers and Kubernetes. I design, develop, deploy, and support complex distributed, optimized, high-load, fault-tolerant systems. I possess strong debugging skills and expertise in solving complex distributed problems. I have 12 years of industry experience, including 5 years working with Python and 3 years with Golang. In my free time, I enjoy staying activeâ€”dancing occasionally, longboarding, and spending time with interesting people. I'm also interested in DIY projects and strive to learn something new every day. I love walking with my dog.
